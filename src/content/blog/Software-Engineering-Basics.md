Ever wondered what it was like to develop software professionally? Maybe you took a college course or two, or dabbled at home in the ever increasing availability and proliferation of programming languages. Or maybe you are here because you've done nothing, and are just very interested! 

When I got into programming in the 1900s (yes, it existed), there were so few resources and fewer ways of connecting to other programmers that school was really the only option at the age I was. Later in life, I took an opportunity to get into professional software development at the food service company I worked in the restaurants for, a certain... culty-popular California burger chain. 

While I am forever grateful for the opportunity (which positively changed the trajectory of my life), I also had little to no guidance on industry practices, what professional groups or communities were out there, and what it meant to work in an "Engineering" wing within a broader organization.

What I hoping to accomplish here is introducing and expanding on a large number of topics that may or may not come up in traditional schooling or prep courses (boot camps, etc). We will focus on a lot of 'basics', however I will also be introducing more intermediate topics like automated testing and logging / observability.
